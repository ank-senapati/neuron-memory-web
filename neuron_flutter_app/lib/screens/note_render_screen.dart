final String plain_text = '''Meeting Notes: Arbitrage Model for Index Basket Trading

I. Introduction and Overview

The meeting began with a discussion on implementing an arbitrage trading model based on pricing inefficiencies
between index baskets and their underlying assets.
The objective is to exploit price discrepancies between an index (e.g., S&P-like basket) and its component
stocks, creating arbitrage opportunities.

II. Key Concepts

Arbitrage: Exploiting price discrepancies between an index and its component stocks
Pricing Inefficiencies: Sum of individual stock prices may not match the index price due to supply-demand
dynamics
Strategy:+ If index price > sum of components → Short index, Long components+ If index price < sum of components → Long index, Short components

III. Structure and Positions

Three assets and two baskets: Basket A (all 3 assets), Basket B (2 of the 3)
Types of Arbitrage:+ Arbitrage between Basket A and all 3 products+ Arbitrage between Basket B and the 2 products+ Arbitrage using Basket A = Basket B + Product 3

IV. Current Progress

Entry logic for trades has been implemented
Remaining Tasks:+ Implement position liquidation logic when prices converge+ Ensure no position limits are exceeded when using overlapping products across multiple baskets

V. Conclusion and Next Steps

Review of the implementation progress and any challenges encountered
Confirmation of the current status and plans for implementing position liquidation logic and ensuring no
position limits exceedances''';
